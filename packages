Could be interesting, but most probably overkill or already a feature in one of
the "must have's"

Cask                 - project management for emacs package development
find-file-in-project - find files in project quickly
imenu-anywhere       - provides navigation for imenu tags across all buffers
                       that satisfy grouping criteria

flx-ido              - https://github.com/lewang/flx
